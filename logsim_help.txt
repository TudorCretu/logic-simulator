Supported type names and port names of devices:

AND (AND gate): requires a /parameter indicating how many inputs it has.
		This parameter is an integer from 1 to 16.
	For an AND gate GATE:
		Its output is 'GATE'. Its inputs can be GATE.I1, GATE.I2, ...

NAND (NAND gate): requires a /parameter indicating how many inputs it has.
		This parameter is an integer from 1 to 16.
	For a NAND gate GATE:
		Its output is GATE. Its inputs can be GATE.I1, GATE.I2, ...

OR (OR gate): requires a /parameter indicating how many inputs it has.
		This parameter is an integer from 1 to 16.
	For an OR gate 'GATE':
		Its output is GATE. Its inputs can be GATE.I1, GATE.I2, ...

NOR (NOR gate): requires a /parameter indicating how many inputs it has.
		This parameter is an integer from 1 to 16.
	For a NOR gate GATE:
		Its output is GATE. Its inputs can be GATE.I1, GATE.I2, ...

SWITCH (switch): requires a /parameter indicating its initial state (0 or 1).

CLOCK (clock): requires a /parameter indicating number of simulation cycles in half a clock period.

SIGGEN (signal generator): requires a /parameter indicating the signal pattern it generates.
		There can only be 0 and 1 in the parameter string.

XOR (XOR gate): It does not need any parameter.
	For a XOR gate GATE:
		Its output is GATE. Its 2 inputs are GATE.I1, GATE.I2, ...

DTYPE (D-type flip-flop): It does not need any parameter.
	For a D-flip-flop DFF:
		Its 2 outputs are DFF.Q and DFF.Q_BAR.
		Its 4 inputs are DFF.CLK, DFF.SET, DFF.CLEAR, DFF.DATA.
